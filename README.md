# Project Description

Minesweeper is a single-player logic puzzle game where the goal is to clear a grid containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. The board starts off as a 10 by 10 grid and the player will have the option to choose between an easy, medium, or hard mode. The easy mode contains 10 mines, medium mode contains 20 mines, and hard mode contains 30 mines. The player will click on random grid pieces and a number will be revealed, indicating the amount of mines present in the eight squares adjacent to the square they clicked. The player will be able to place a red-flag by right-clicking on a tile to indicate that a mine is present at that location. The player will continue clicking grid pieces until all non-mine pieces have been revealed, in which a winning screen will appear. If the player clicked on a mine, the game is lost and a losing screen will appear.
