Group Name: TBA

Project Description: Minesweeper: Minesweeper is a single-player logic puzzle game where the goal is to clear a grid containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. The player will have the option to choose between an easy (10x10 grid), medium (15x15 grid), or hard (20x20 grid) mode, which corresponds to how large the board is. The player will click on random grid pieces and a number will be revealed, indicating the amount of mines present in the eight squares adjacent to the square they clicked. The player will be able to place a red-flag by right-clicking on a square to indicate that a mine is present at that location. The player will continue clicking grid pieces until all non-mine pieces have been revealed.

Expanded Description:
Critical features (Minimum Viable Product): We should be able to visually see the board of minesweeper and being able to click on a square and revealing what that square is. 
Diagrams: Not needed. 
Nice to have features: 
-Losing and wining screen
-Animations
-A scoreboard for the flags and time spent
-Different difficulties 
-Music and sharing your game
-Leaderboard
-Loading Screen


     
# Project Design

# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

~A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)~

To break up the work, both of us can share the work of making the visual game and then doing the extra features by ourselves. 

* Make the visual game (Finish by 5/28/25 everything except animations)
  * Make the board grids ( Both of us )
  * Make the buttons that are safe and has mines (Both of us )
  * Make the animations (This should be finished last as it is low priority so 5/31/25) (Both of us )
   
* Losing and Winning screen (Finish by 5/30/25) (Ricky)
  
* Scoreboard and leaderboard (Finish by 5/30/25) (Emily)
  * A score of counting how many flags you have left
  * A score of time
  * Compare the timing of completing a certain difficulty. 
  
* Different difficulties (5/31/25) (Both )
  
* Loading screen, music,  and a way to share your game (Finish by 5/31/25) (Both)
