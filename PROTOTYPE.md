Project Description: Minesweeper: Our goal is to make a working game of minesweeper with randomized flags placed on a square grid. The player will have the option to choose an easy (10x10 grid), medium (15x15 grid), or hard (20x20 grid) mode which corresponds to how large the board is. The player will click on random grid pieces and a number will be revealed, indicating the amount of flags near the space they clicked. The player will continue clicking grid pieces until all non-flag pieces have been revealed. Link: https://minesweeperonline.com/#

Expanded Description:
Critical features (Minimum Viable Product): We should be able to visually see the board of minesweeper and being able to click on a square and revealing what that square is. 
Diagrams: Not needed. 
Nice to have features: 
-Losing and wining screen
-Animations
-A scoreboard for the flags and time spent
-Different difficulties 
-Music and sharing your game
-Leaderboard
