# IDEAS:

Minesweeper
Our goal is to make a working game of minesweeper with randomized flags placed on a square grid. The player will have the option to choose an easy (10x10 grid), medium (15x15 grid), or hard (20x20 grid) mode which corresponds to how large the board is. The player will click on random grid pieces and a number will be revealed, indicating the amount of flags near the space they clicked. The player will continue clicking grid pieces until all non-flag pieces have been revealed.

Chess
We want to make a game of chess. Make a board of 8 by 8 that has all the pieces in chess and you can move them around according to the rules. It’ll be a multiplayer game. Whoever checkmates the other player first wins the game.

Battleships
We will create a grid of 10 by 10 with 5 randomized ships of different lengths and orientations placed on it. The player will then try to guess where the opposite player’s ships are. Whoever finds all the ships of the other player wins.
