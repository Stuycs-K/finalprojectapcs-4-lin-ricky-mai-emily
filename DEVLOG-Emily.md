Discussed timeline of the development phases and who is responsible for each part with partner. (1 period)

### 2025-05-21 - UML Diagram Creation
Created a UML Diagram with the different classes we will implement and added a description of how each class works. Discussed group names with partner and added it to the prototype, and edited some of the formatting for better clarity. (1 hour)

### 2025-05-22 - Began Coding the Classes
Created the class files in processing and added the instance variables and some method signatures. I created my own branch, emily, and familiarized myself with the process of merging branches and fixing merge conflicts. Also, I wrote the board constructor and began the setup and draw methods. (1 period + 30 mins)

### 2025-05-23 - Started creating the board
Worked on the board and tile constructor to initialize the board. (1 period)

### 2025-05-27 - Continued making the board
Continued working on the board constructor and added a firstclick variable because we don't want the firstclick to be a mine. I merged my partner's and my branch to keep it up to date with the main. Also, I wrote drawSquares to fill the screen with alternating colored squares. (1 period + 30 mins)

### 2025-05-28 - Continued making the visual board
I worked on the method drawBoard by adding a rectangle to act as the header and calling drawSquares. (1 period)

### 2025-05-29 - Header Creation
Fixed the method drawSquares to create a checkboard pattern of alternating colored squares. Made a header at the top of the screen that will show the time and flag count, and fixed the screen sizing to ensure all the rows and columns are shown. (1 period + 30 mins)
